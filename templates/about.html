        <p class="pharagraph hidden">I am Tarun, originally from Bangalore. I had my schooling at the Cambridge School, and my 11th and 12th at Saint Joseph's Pre-University. Technology has always been something I have been passionate about, ever since I watched Iron Man as a child. My passion for technology only increased and at the age of 14 I started to learn how to code. I started with HTML, and since then I have been learning various coding languages and techniques. I am excited to see how far my knowledge and experience can take me in the world of technology. I am currently learning Python and am looking forward to exploring more of the cutting-edge technology available today. I am confident that my dedication and hard work will enable me to become a successful software engineer. As a software developer, I gained some experience in web development, working with databases, and creating user-friendly applications.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="div ">
        <p class="pharagraphal hidden">I am eager to leverage my existing knowledge and skills to continue to grow and excel in the technology space. I am determined to stay up- to-date on the latest trends and technologies and am committed to contributing my knowledge to the industry. I believe that my strong technical background and passion for learning and growing gives me the foundation I need to stay ahead of the curve. I am also committed to continuing my education and honing my skills to remain competitive. I am confident that with my dedication and hard work, I can become a successful software engineer. Also, I have gained some experience from my internship and volunteer experience in the software engineering field. I am familiar with coding languages such as Java, C++, and Python and have worked with various technologies, including web development and mobile app development. With my current knowledge and experience, I am well-prepared to take on challenging software engineering roles and make a positive contribution to the team. For instance, I designed a mobile application for a local non-profit organization during my internship, which  may be  successful in helping the organizations to  manage their resources better</p>
    </div>
    <div class="div ">
        <p class="pharagraphall hidden">This is similar to taking a sculpting class in art school and creating an impressive clay sculpture; the knowledge and experience I have gained in the software engineering field is like the tools I need to create works of art. Now I still admire the growing technology and its potential to make a positive difference in the world. I am constantly learning new skills and exploring new ideas to create impactful software solutions.  As Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once wrote: “The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.”  With the right tools, I have the potential to create something great. Drawing inspiration from this, I strive to create technology that will make a meaningful impact on people's lives and connect them in ways that no physical touch can. The first known programmable machine was the Jacquard loom, invented in 1801 by Frenchman Joseph Marie Jacquard to automatically weave fabrics with complex designs. His invention represented a monumental step forward in the automation of manufacturing processes, and it continues to be a source of inspiration for modern-day technologies that can make a difference in people's lives. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div ">
        <p class="pharagraphal hidden">The Jacquard loom is like a cornerstone in the history of automation – it laid the foundations for future innovations and transformations that continue to shape the world we live in. I admire the engineering genius behind the Jacquard loom, and I am inspired to build something similar that could also make a difference in people's lives. I am determined to create a technology that is as revolutionary as the Jacquard loom.
            I believe that technology should be used to make life easier and better for everyone. I am committed to making that happen. I'm sure it won't be as hard as weaving together a tapestry of the Mona Lisa! I'm going to start by researching and learning more about the Jacquard loom and its components. Then, I plan to experiment and create a prototype of my own invention, and eventually, I hope to have a successful product that has the potential to positively impact people's lives. After that, I plan to get feedback from users and refine my invention. Finally, I hope to launch it to the public and make it available to everyone who can benefit from it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="div ">
        <p class="pharagraphall hidden">I also plan to post my content on many social media platforms to spread awareness and generate interest in my invention. To ensure I am successful, I will use my writing skills to create compelling content to promote my invention, and I will use my expertise in digital marketing to reach my target audience. I will also focus on creating a user-friendly website that provides helpful resources to potential users and allows them to easily purchase my product. Additionally, I will contact industry professionals and influencers in the field to get their feedback and opinion on my invention before launching it. This will help me create a successful product that meets the needs of my target audience. To stay up-to-date with my progress, make sure to follow my social media handles. That's it for now, and I hope you have found this page informative. Thank you for reading!  As the famous American humorist Will Rogers once said: “If you want to be successful, it's just this simple. Know what you are doing. Love what you are doing. And believe in what you are doing.” And don't forget to have fun while doing it - that's the most important part!</p>
